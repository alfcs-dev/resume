Web Resume
====================

Personal resume using, angularjs, angular-material and angular translate
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the second version I create as a web profile, it contains my basic info, 
a summary of my experience as an introduction, and sections in which I describe my latest
jobs, projects and skills.

### To use it:

1. Git clone the repo.
2. Install node dependencies with __npm install__.
3. Install bower dependencies with **bower install**.
4. Run Grunt to see it work


### To edit it

Once you have it running all the main files are in the folder *src* and separated by type of file.
Grunt will create the dist file to test.
